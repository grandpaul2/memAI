**Components Implemented**:
- `SimpleTokenCounter`: Enhanced token estimation with pattern recognition
- `ModelSpecificMemory`: Isolated memory files with collision-safe naming
- `AdaptiveBudgetManager`: Complexity-aware context allocation
- `SafetyValidator`: Comprehensive validation framework

**Key Features**:
- 20% safety margin in token calculations
- Hash-based filename collision prevention
- Anti-gaming complexity analysis
- Structured error reporting

### Session 2: System Integration

**Components Implemented**:
- `UnifiedMemoryManager`: Central orchestrator integrating all Session 1 components
- `UnifiedMemoryInterface`: Backward-compatible interface layer
- Migration logic for legacy memory data
- Comprehensive integration testing

**Critical Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed shallow copy issue causing shared memory references between models
- Corrected migration integrity validation logic
- Resolved budget allocation exceeding context window limits

### Session 3: Production Integration

**Integration Points**:
- `ollama_universal_interface.py`: Main application interface updated
- Automatic memory system selection (unified vs legacy fallback)
- Model-aware context preparation
- Seamless backward compatibility

## Performance Characteristics
