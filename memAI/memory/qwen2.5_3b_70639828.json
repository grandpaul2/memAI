      "user": "How long have I been using Tableau?",
      "assistant": "I'm sorry, but there seems to be a bit of confusion here. The information you provided earlier states that you've been using Tableau for about 2 years now, while the question asks how long you have been using it.\n\nTo clarify:\n- You mentioned having used Tableau for around 2 years.\n- Now I'm asking about how long you have been using Tableau in general (not just within your current role or organization).\n\nIf you want to share more details about when you started using Tableau, that would be great. Do you recall the exact date or year you began working with Tableau? This will help me provide more personalized and relevant advice based on how long you've been using it."
